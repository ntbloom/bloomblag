      <description>Python is an amazing language and its interpreted nature makes for super easy development workflows. Without the need for a compilation step or complicated builds, running your code can be as simple as running python app.py in your project&amp;rsquo;s root directory.
However, like every problem that is infinitely more complicated than that blog post you read last week, it&amp;rsquo;s usually not a simple as that. You&amp;rsquo;re probably using a virtual environment.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Kissing cousins&amp;rdquo; remains one of my all-time favorite American folk-humor memes. I&amp;rsquo;m still not exactly sure what it refers to, but I have some ideas, all hilarious:
 Possible definitions:
 cousins far enough apart where fornication is socially acceptable (kissing is a euphemism) cousins far enough apart where fornication is not socially acceptable but kissing is (kissing is not a euphemism) two people who haven&amp;rsquo;t spoken since the awkward family reunion when they were both 15 (she had a different last name!</description>

      <description>Postgresql is amazing. Like, I want to go back in time and give the person (people? had to have been people, right?) who wrote it a hug. I started my software engineering journey as an excel monkey, and after cutting my teeth on vlookup hell, I was blown away by the power, simplicity, and safety guaranteed by a full-fledged database engine.
 Microsoft Excel is the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest GUI-based non-transactional relational database with no type safety, user permissions layer, or logging.</description>

      <title>Does Hello World Count in Markdown?</title>

      <description>Hello World is one of my favorite arcane traditions in the world of software engineering. While it represents a seemingly simple task &amp;ndash; can you print a sentence on the screen? &amp;ndash; it symbolizes the power of software to do amazing things.
Unlike its ugly cousins foo, bar, and baz, Hello World is a much kinder friend who invites you to show off your newfound skills to whoever out there who might be listening.</description>
